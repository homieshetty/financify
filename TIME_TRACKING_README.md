## üí∞ Salary Calculation Rules

### **Base Structure:**
- **Standard Duty**: 7 hours = ‚Çπ350 base pay
- **Overtime Rate**: ‚Çπ50 per hour (beyond 7 hours)

### **Examples:**
```
7 hours worked = ‚Çπ350 (base pay only)
8 hours worked = ‚Çπ400 (‚Çπ350 + ‚Çπ50 overtime)
10 hours worked = ‚Çπ500 (‚Çπ350 + ‚Çπ150 overtime)
12 hours worked = ‚Çπ600 (‚Çπ350 + ‚Çπ250 overtime)
```

### **Automatic Updates:**
- When time is tracked, wages are recalculated automatically
- Assignment status changes to 'completed'
- Overtime is calculated and added to base pay

## üóÑÔ∏è Database Migration

### **If you have an existing database:**

1. **Run the migration script** in Supabase SQL Editor:
   ```sql
   -- Copy and paste content from database_migration.sql
   ```

2. **Verify the changes**:
   - Check that `entryTime` and `exitTime` columns exist
   - Confirm existing data is preserved

### **For new installations:**
- Use the updated `database_setup.sql` which includes time tracking fields
